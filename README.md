# SpaceShooter: Real-Time Embedded Arcade Game on Nucleo with C++ and Nokia 5110 LCD

This project is a space-themed arcade game developed in C++ specifically for embedded systems, running on a Nucleo microcontroller paired with a Nokia 5110 LCD and an analog joystick. It features real-time gameplay with custom pixel art sprites, intuitive joystick controls, and a robust object-oriented design. The game includes an interactive menu system allowing players to navigate through Play, Tutorial, and Customize options. Gameplay involves dynamic space combat with shooting mechanics, meteor obstacles, a lives system for health management, and a scoring system that tracks current and personal best scores. Players can unlock new spacecraft sprites, such as SU-57 and F-35, by achieving high scores, adding a progression and customization element.

Technically, the project integrates hardware components like the N5110 display with optimized contrast settings and joystick inputs for precise control. The software architecture is modular, built around classes like GameEngine, Spaceship, and Bullet, which encapsulate game logic and entities. Custom graphics are stored efficiently in 2D arrays, including backgrounds of planets like Earth and Saturn, star fields, and UI elements, all rendered smoothly at 50 frames per second. The system manages multiple game states including menus, gameplay, tutorials, and game-over screens, while ensuring efficient memory usage and responsive controls through input debouncing and selective screen updates.

The project demonstrates skills in embedded C++ programming, including low-level hardware interaction, real-time system design, custom graphics programming, user interface development, and game logic implementation.

Overall, this project showcases the integration of hardware and software, advanced object-oriented design principles, and real-time programming on embedded platforms.
